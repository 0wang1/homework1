# homework1
For this assignment I mostly self-taught through tutorials online (youtube, W3Schools, etc)
to find out where I was messing up. There were a ton of nuances to learn, and I no doubt
spent a huge majority of my weekend playing around with CSS and HTML, but not getting as far as I thought I would. For example, despite all the marginal errors I made I cannot for the life of me figure out how to align the bottom terminal icon with the contact list or figure out why my overlay won't show up despite everything looking like it should!!! The journey
completing this assignment was definitely worth it, but I wish I could have known all
necessary resources required beforehand because the majority of my time was wasted scrolling
through unhelpful tutorials and stackoverflow answers. I REALLY wish I could've figured out why my overlay wasn't working. I don't even think time would help me since I probably spent 5-6 hours trying to figure it out... and I've included my progress thus far if it's worth anything.
