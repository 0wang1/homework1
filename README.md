# homework1
For this assignment I mostly self-taught through tutorials online (youtube, W3Schools, etc)
to find out where I was messing up. There were a ton of nuances to learn, and I no doubt
spent the majority of my weekend playing around with CSS and HTML, but not getting as far as
I thought I would. For example, despite all the marginal errors I made I cannot for the life
of me figure out how to align the bottom terminal icon with the contact list!!! The journey
completing this assignment was definitely worth it, but I wish I could have known all
necessary resources required beforehand because the majority of my time was wasted scrolling
through unhelpful tutorials and stackoverflow answers.
